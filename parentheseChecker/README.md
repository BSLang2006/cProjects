Git Component for C - Valid Matching Parentheses Matching Project

### Overview

The problem descriptions and details are on Prairielearn.
For the git component of the project, you will need
to commit and upload your code to this github repo.

As you work, add and commit your changes to your source code file(s).
Note: you should be doing this locally on either your personal computer
or EOS. You are free to push commits as you work or all at the end,
but make sure they are all pushed at the end.

Your score for this portion will be based on you:
* having multiple commits (bare minimum of 4-5, preferably more)
* having commits that show me you can actually use git for the purposes of
  version control (this means that your commits should be made throughout your 
  development process and correspond to various parts you work on).
  A good example would be to commit anytime you get some small part working.
* having good, descriptive commit messages (they don't have to be long,
  but they do need to be something you could use if you needed to
  in order to go back to a previous version of your work)
* committing from git using the command line (using the Github's
  file upload will earn none of the points for the git portion
  as it fails to show me you know how to use git correctly)

Note, you only need to commit the code files themselves (not the
output files you get when you compile the code).
